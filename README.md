# Student_Intervention
This repository contains project files for the ‘Student Intervention’ project as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. The project can be viewed by opening 'student_intervention.html' in a web browser, or can be run interactively by opening 'student_intervention.ipynb' in a Jupyter Notebook. 

**Note** This project is no longer included in the Nanodegree program, but all final project files have been graded and approved by Udacity.

In this project, I examine a dataset containing data for 395 students enrolled in particular college or university. The data for each student includes 30 different features. I then explore several different Machine Learning classifiers to predict which students are at risk of failing to graduate on time, based on their features. The final tuned model reaches a prediction accuracy of 86%. A college or university may use this kind of technology to help at-risk students get back on track to graduate before it is too late. 

Starter files provided by Udacity are in the 'Student Intervention Starter Files' folder.
