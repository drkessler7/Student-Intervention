With this type of problem, we would try to predict a studentâ€™s grade, and then see if that grade is high enough to pass or not. \n",

    "**Answer: ** Since this is a classification problem, I chose three supervised learning models that are better suited for predicting what group a new, unseen input would fall into. The three models that I chose are: the Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and the Decision Tree Classifier. These are very strong classification models that can predict discrete values for test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a form of the broader Support Vector Machine (SVM). These are used in finance to do things like make predictions on the price movements of certain stocks or indexes. They are also used in mechanically-oriented industries  to make predictions on what pieces of machinery are going to fail or need maintenance (Kimotho et al. 619-620).\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs work well with complicated data domains having high dimensional spaces. This model can also be effective in cases where the number of features is greater than the number of samples. SVMs are versatile, as they can employ different Kernel functions, including custom kernels. SVMs are not well suited for data sets that are very large, as the training time has a more than quadratic relation to the size of the data set (\"1.4. Support Vector Machines â€” Scikit-Learn 0.17.1 Documentation\").\n",
    "\n",
    "It is for these reasons that I chose this model for this dataset. There are a large number of features in the student dataset relative to the number of samples, but the number of samples is not so great that it will overwhelm the SVC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is modeled after biological neurons that operate in a web-like, interlinked structure. Since they are modeled after biological neural systems, ANNs are used in various medical fields to gain better understanding of how those biological systems work (Strickland). The perceptron is one of several different elements that can be used in building an ANN, and is the one used in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks are extremely powerful, as they can model very complex relationships between features. They are able to learn from the data itself. Because of this, less understanding is needed of the underlying data. Downsides of ANNs are that they can take a long time to train and require significant processing power for large datasets. Also, the trained model is not easy to understand (Hamilton). \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to use an ANN because the student dataset has many features that may have complex relationships with one another. The dataset is not too large, and so will not overwhelm this kind of model. However, since this model is so computationally intensive, it may not be the best choice if it must be run often or quickly to satisfy the needs of the client. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are used in many fields such as finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. In finance, for example, a mortgage company may use Decision Trees to classify a potential customer as being risky or non-risky in terms of being able to pay back the mortgage on time (Rokach and Maimon 9-11).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees and the results they produce are simple to understand conceptually. It is easier to graphically represent the results of a Decision Tree than it is to represent the results of most other classifiers, such as SVMs. Since they are relatively simple, it is possible to build more complex and powerful classifiers using Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "A downside to Decision Trees is that they can be prone to overfitting the data, especially if a lot of features are involved. This can be combated somewhat by tuning the parameters of the tree carefully. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would consider this model for this kind of application because it is simple. Its simplicity would allow us to help explain and graphically show the problem to the board of directors, making it easier for them to understand. Decision Trees can also help to extract relationships between certain features. This in itself is useful, to help better understand the underlying features that may influence a student to graduate or not. \n",
